# Input Devices Try-Out

## Description
Experience data collection with digital and analog input devices. 

Pick one sensor from a collection and try it out with the prototyping breadboard. Connect the sensor to the suitable pin-headers and test it with a program. Read the sensorâ€™s data using the Serial Monitor. 

Repeat the exercise with at least two digital and two analog sensors. Understand how the sensor works and how data is collected and used.

## Documentation
Document the four sensors and the Arduino codes (attention: Github uses Markdown language, if you paste Arduino code here, it will be rendered by Markdown, so plz find the way to show your Arduino codes).
